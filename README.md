# DayParts Time Keeping

#### Note: All you really need is the files in [The game folder](game). Just one small script file. This can be dropped into a new or existing project and a label called to view an example (details in the .rpy file).

### Please note:

The way this approach works might not be suitable for complete beginners. It is a basic platform on which to build a system that might grow to include other features. As such it will likely require some knowledge of Ren'Py in order to extend it to your particular needs. 

Though I have tried to explain it as simply as possible, I will not be available to help extend it unless under a paid contract.
Basically, if you want it to do more, you are expected to know enough Ren'Py to handle that yourself (or consider paying someone)
